# Receipt Scanner Changelog

## Version 2.1.0 - Database Integration & Image Storage

### 🚀 Major Features Added

#### ✅ Persistent Database Storage
- **SQLAlchemy Integration**: Replaced in-memory storage with SQLite database
- **Data Persistence**: All receipt data now persists between server restarts
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced schema with additional metadata fields
- **Automatic Migrations**: Database tables created automatically on startup

#### ✅ Image Storage System
- **Image Persistence**: Original receipt images are now stored on disk
- **Image Retrieval**: New API endpoint to serve stored receipt images
- **Image Display**: Frontend now shows receipt images in review and list views
- **Thumbnail Generation**: List view displays small thumbnails for each receipt

#### ✅ Enhanced Data Model
- **Extended Fields**: Added processing metadata, confidence scores, OCR text
- **Soft Delete**: Receipts are soft-deleted (marked as deleted but preserved)
- **Timestamps**: Automatic created_at and updated_at tracking
- **Image Metadata**: Store image paths and URLs for each receipt

### 🔧 API Improvements

#### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/receipts/{id}/image` - Retrieve original receipt image
- Enhanced all existing endpoints to use database storage

#### Database Schema
```sql
receipts:
- id (Primary Key)
- store_name, purchase_date, total_amount
- category, items (JSON), payment_method, tax_amount
- processing_mode, confidence_score, ocr_text
- image_path, image_url
- user_id (for future authentication)
- created_at, updated_at, uploaded_at
- is_deleted (soft delete flag)
```

### 🎨 Frontend Enhancements

#### Receipt Review View
- **Image Display**: Shows original receipt image alongside extracted data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when images cannot be loaded
- **Responsive Design**: Images scale appropriately on different screen sizes

#### Receipt List View
- **Thumbnails**: 48x48px thumbnails for each receipt in the list
- **Fallback UI**: Shows placeholder when thumbnail fails to load
- **Improved Layout**: Better visual hierarchy with image, text, and actions

### 📁 File Structure Changes

#### Backend
```
app/
├── database.py          # Database configuration
├── db_models.py         # SQLAlchemy models
├── main.py             # Updated with database integration
└── ...
receipts_images/        # Directory for stored images
test_db.py             # Database testing script
init_db.py             # Database initialization
```

#### Frontend
```
src/
├── api/index.ts        # Added getReceiptImageUrl function
├── types/index.ts      # Updated ReceiptData interface
├── App.tsx            # Added image display components
└── ...
```

### 🛠️ Development Tools

#### Database Testing
- **test_db.py**: Comprehensive database testing script
- **init_db.py**: Manual database initialization utility
- **Health Checks**: Verify database connectivity and operations

#### Dependencies Added
- **Backend**: sqlalchemy>=2.0.23, alembic>=1.13.0
- **Frontend**: No new dependencies (uses existing functionality)

### 📋 Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Database Migration Required**
- First-time setup will automatically create database tables
- Existing in-memory data will be lost (data was not persistent before)
- New receipt uploads will be stored in the database and file system

⚠️ **API Response Format**
- Receipt objects now include additional fields:
  - `processing_mode`, `confidence_score`, `image_path`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps
  - `items` (JSON array), `payment_method`

### 🔮 Future Enhancements Ready

#### Authentication Framework
- Database schema includes `user_id` field
- Ready for JWT authentication implementation

#### Advanced Analytics
- Rich database schema supports complex queries
- Ready for time-based analytics and reporting

#### Cloud Storage
- Image storage abstraction ready for cloud providers
- `image_url` field prepared for cloud storage URLs

### 📖 Usage

#### Running with Database
```bash
# Backend
cd receipt-scanner-app/receipt-scanner-backend
python init_db.py  # Optional: initialize database manually
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (no changes to startup)
cd receipt-scanner-app/receipt-scanner-frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Testing Database
```bash
cd receipt-scanner-app/receipt-scanner-backend
python test_db.py
```

### 🐛 Fixes and Improvements

- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Receipts no longer lost on server restart
- ✅ **Image Recovery**: Can view original receipt images after upload
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing images
- ✅ **Performance**: Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- ✅ **Scalability**: Ready for production deployment with proper database

### 🔄 Migration Notes

For users upgrading from previous versions:
1. All previous receipt data will be lost (was in-memory only)
2. New uploads will be properly stored and persistent
3. Frontend interface enhanced but maintains same workflow
4. All existing functionality preserved and enhanced
